App Release 2 

Overview - 

The purpose of this project is to generate a simple text-based calculator using Visual Studio. The calculator must be able to take two numbers and perform addition, multiplication, division, subtraction and showing an error message when the user tried to divide by 0, along with if the user does not input a proper calculation. For example “Select an operator +, -“and they select 5, now select 2 numbers, after the sure inputs something it will read a “Sorry, I’m not sure I can do this.”

Intital Logic and Technical Approach - 

The main goal of this project is to create a simple text-based calculator to perform simple calculations. Now, the program is built using C arithmetic operators and these operators would present themselves to the user and then use the case and break statements to take the arithmetic operations along with the two numbers that will be asked of the user. It will now make the calculation and each operator and numbers inputted will have different results being outputted. The creation of this calculator will demonstrate the C programs basic code composition, loops, and decision making. 

App release1 did not have the outcome that I wanted. A lot of overthinking and errors when it came to the coding portion of the project. In the release the test cases were poorly implemented, and I could not get the division by 0 error message to display. After feedback from app release one, I spent more time with this release and became more careful with my coding and had to start all over again after reading material and setting up a game plan.

App release 2, after testing and debugging should now be able to ask the user to “select an operation +, -, *,/” and take the input of the user to then ask them to “select two number” and if the operation is valid the calculator is give them an answer. If the operation is not arithmetic, the calculator will display s invalid choice and if the operation is division by 0, show error.

Risk - 

The most common mistakes made by new coders creating applications are human errors. This is a main topic split in many different sections. To start, new coders tend to make a lot of errors, and this could be through spelling mistake or invalid code formats. Next, coders can become lazy and impact their productivity. This could be by a noticeably big distraction and new coders may hate their team and members or given a long deadline for a project and cram in all their work weeks before because of poor time management. Finally using online resources. Some of online resources are not verified and if coders use codes online, they could be causing serious harm to their project and potentially their company security. Now as the projects get more complicated so do the risks, but the black box and white box testing methods would help with testing the software and application before release to help mitigate any doubt for risks. A black box test just means it is used to test software without any knowledge of the structure of thing being tested. White box is an approach the opposite, where the tester knows the internal structure of.
